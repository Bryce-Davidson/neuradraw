# Summary

Neuradraw came from the desire to be able to draw complex neural network architectures with a variety of different colors and annotations. The project's conception is based here in the `neuradraw` repository but continues in 3 different flavors and versions. Those flavors and versions are:

[`Neuradraw-2`](https://github.com/Bryce-Davidson/neuradraw-2), [`Neuradraw-ts`](https://github.com/Bryce-Davidson/neuradraw-ts) & [`Neuradraw-node`](https://github.com/Bryce-Davidson/neuradraw-node)

The reasons for moving on to developing on a different code base and paradigm are included below in the discontinued section.

## Discontinued Reasons

Decided that p5.js wasn't enough out of the box functionality for my use case. I will build my version of p5.js and incorporate webpack to allow access to npm in neuradraw-2.
